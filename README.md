### FreeCodeCamp's Project 4 | Technical Documentation

Check out the final result [here](https://ericrubinoff.github.io/FCC-Project-4/).

##### Introduction

Thrilled to have finished the fourth project on FCC's Responsive Web Design course!

##### Goal

This project consisted on creating a technical documentation page with a fixed sidebar on desktop view and a top navbar on lower screens and mobile devices. 

##### Challenge

The biggest challenge by far was creating a responsive layout and understanding how to change the design from the sidebar to the navbar by reducing the viewport size. This was achieved through the use of media queries and many small adjustments. 

Stackoverflow was extremely helpful on the CSS side of things and from the start this project was created in VSCode and uploaded periodically to this repo.
